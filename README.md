# FDSE computational projects
This project contains documentation and scripts for the computational projects for the Fluid Dynamics of Sustainability and the Environment (FDSE) summer school. If you spot any typos or have suggestions for the project descriptions or code, please create a pull request or create an issue on github.

The projects use the Julia programming language. 
If you are new to Julia, this document contains a quickstart guide:

Julia is a modern programming language which is as easy to use as python or Matlab, but provides the speed of languages like Fortran and C.

Julia comes with a REPL (which stands for read-evaluate-print-loop) which provides a command-line interface much like python or Matlab. While it is possible to use this on its own, we suggest using a code development platform which provides a single tool to edit and run the scripts and display plots. In particular, we recommend Visual Studio Code which is an excellent tool and free to use.

To get started, follow these steps:
1. Download and install the latest stable version of Julia for your platform (linux, windows, mac) here: https://julialang.org/downloads
2. Download and install Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. If you don't already have one, create a free account on http://github.com (click the sign-up button in the top right corner).
4. Log in to http://github.com and fork this repository
5. Run Visual Studio Code (VS code)
6. Open the extensions tab (the icon on the left side of the window with 4 squares)
7. Find and install the Julia Language Support extension in VS code
8. Find and install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in VS code
9. Quit and re-open VS code to activate the extensions

For the next steps, see the project description files inside each project folder.

I hope you enjoy the projects!
