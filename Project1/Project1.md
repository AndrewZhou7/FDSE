This project will introduce you to Oceananigans and explore the dynamics of gravity currents

To start, we need to install Oceananigans. To do this, open VS Code (if you don't already have it open).
From the menu bar, select "View" and "Command Palette"
Enter "Julia: Start REPL" and press enter. This should bring up a window in VS Code with a Julia prompt.

Julia has a fantastic package manager for installing and updating add-on packages. To install Oceananigans, follow these steps:
1. To enter the package manager interface, press the "]" key. The "julia>" prompt should change to "pkg>".
2. Install Oceananigans by typing "add Oceananigans" and pressing enter (note that this may take a while since it downloads and installs all of the packages that Oceananigans depends on)
3. After Oceananigans has downloaded and installed, exit the package manager by pressing the delete key
