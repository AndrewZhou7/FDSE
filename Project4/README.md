# Ocean ecosystem dynamics

Microscopic algae called phytoplankton form the foundation of the ocean's food web and are responsible for about half of the primary production (photosynthesis) on the earth.
As demonstrated in the figures below, when conditions are favorable, phytoplankton often appear in rapid growth events called blooms, but they can also die out quickly when their growth is limited by nutrients or grazing by predators called zooplankton.
Fluid dynamics has a very strong influence on phytoplankton (and hence the global carbon cycle). Sunlight needed for photosynthesis illuminates a relatively thin layer of the upper ocean. When phytoplankton are advected into the dark ocean interior for extended periods of time, they will become dormant or die. Different populations of phytoplankton, the nutrients that they rely on, and their predators are co-mingled and mixed by ocean currents.
